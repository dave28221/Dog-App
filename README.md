Project Title - The Dog FETCHI API application

To initialize the application, cd into the application using the terminal, and run "npm install"

Description: This small front end React application retrieves an API, and then displays it in a grid format. Upon page refresh, new images and data (of a variety of dog breeds) will be displayed within the grid. Users can access the JSON "breed data" by clicking the "learn more about this dog" button, and then hide the data by clicking the "Hide information" button, placed on the unique image cards.

MUI was the UI library which was implemented in the project. This decision was based on research, and after some trial and error with a few libraries, this one seemed to be ideal for what was intended; that being a simple grid layout, that was responsive with breaking points.

While CSS was not needed in the project, I wanted to tidy a few things up, and add some custom CSS for the layout and size of the images.
